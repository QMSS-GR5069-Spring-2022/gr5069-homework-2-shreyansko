# Introduction

**Objective:** The objective of this project is to use unsupervised learning for red wine characteristics. It is manly contains three parts:
* Use K Means Cluster Analysis to identify cluster(s) of observations that have high and low values of the wine quality. 
* Use Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to identify cluster(s) of observations that have high and low values of the wine quality. 
* Use Principal Components Analysis to reduce the dimensions of your data.
